You need to have .NET 6 installed to build & run Jypeli.
For Android-projects, you also need to have `net6-android` workload installed:

```

If you do not wish to run android projects, you can also edit `Jypeli.csproj` & `FarseerPhysics.csproj` and remove `net6-android` from targetframeworks.

Open the main `Jypeli.sln` with Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider.
